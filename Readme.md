## What is MarvelMarks?
A simple password protected, multi-user website that stores user web bookmarks in a MySQL database, much like a standalone version of Google Chrome's bookmark manager addon.

### Tech Stack
 - MySQL
 - PHP 5.5
 - HTML2Canvas
 - PHP 5.5+
 - Apache 2.2

### Todo
Important:
 - Encrypt all stored user bookmark URLs.
 - Regenerate stored hash of user password upon login.
 - Send password reset requests to listed user email.
 - Logically separate all project files into folders.
 - Replace "mysql" function calls with "mysqli" equivalents, as they have been deprecated.

Secondary:
- Add support for user bookmark folders.
- Make main login panel on index.html a Bootstrap panel so it resizes better.

Complete:
- ~~Modal on bookmarks page should not hide scrollbar.~~
